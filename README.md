This game was mainly designed to help autistic children express and understand emotions better.
We gather pictures from the internet from sources such as flickr etc...and then we ask the user to guess if the emotion in the picture corresponds to anger,sadness,happiness or fear.
We will be adding more sources from where we fetch images later on.
